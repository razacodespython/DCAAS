# Develepor Community As A Service (D-CAAS)

DCAAS is a platform that captures valueable interactions between protocols and developers. Developers have questions and seek to interact with protocols. With DCAAS you can do that on our platform or via a telegram bot that you can add in your telegram group chat.

## Platform

On our platform a developer can explore protocols. Each protocal has it's own forum, where devs can come and ask questions. The protocol can come to DCAAS and answer the question. Now other developers can benefit from this interaction. Everything is recorded on chain.

## Bot

If the protocol doesn't want to go to DCAAS, but wants to capture the Q&A interaction from telegram, that's also possible! Add the bot to the chat and tell the bot to push both the questiona and answer to DCAAS.

Any questions posted by devs on DCAAS are pushed via the bot into the telegram chat and can be answered in the telegram chat and then pushed back to DCAAS via the bot.

Information captured, available and searchable, without changing your processes or interface.

## AI powered

The telegram bot is powered by Chat-GPT. It feeds a custom datamodel with the prompt (question from the dev) and the corresponding completion (answer from the protocol). Like this the bot can posses the ability to help devs faster.

When a dev asks a question, the bot can answer. If the answer is valid 2 actions are perfomed:

the protocol can push the question and answer via the bot to the chatgpt model.
the answer gets recorded on chain and visible on DCAAS, so that the knowledge is captured.

## Chains
Currently the protocols that we record the interactions on are:
